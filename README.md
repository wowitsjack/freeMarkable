## System Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or higher** installed on your system
- **reMarkable device** (any generation: 1, 2, or Paper Pro) with SSH access enabled
- **USB or WiFi connection** to your reMarkable device
- **Internet connection** for downloading required components

## Installation & Usage

### Linux Users
```bash
chmod +x launch.sh
./launch.sh
```

### Windows Users
```cmd
launch.bat
```
(or simply double-click the launch.bat file)

The launcher scripts will automatically:
1. Check for Python installation
2. Install required Python dependencies
3. Launch the freeMarkable application

## First Time Setup

1. Run the appropriate launcher script for your operating system
2. Complete the initial setup wizard to configure your reMarkable connection
3. Test the connection to ensure proper communication with your device
4. **Device Auto-Detection** - The app will automatically detect your device type (RM1/RM2/Paper Pro)
5. Choose your installation type (Full installation or Launcher-only)
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation

## Technical Details

### Architecture Detection

freeMarkable uses hardware-level architecture detection to identify your reMarkable device:

- **SSH-Based Detection** - Connects to device and runs `uname -m` to get CPU architecture
- **Automatic Binary Selection** - Downloads correct binaries based on detected architecture
- **No Manual Configuration** - Device type detection is completely automatic

### Binary Compatibility

The application automatically selects the correct binaries for your device:

**reMarkable 1/2 (32-bit ARM):**
- XOVI Extensions: `extensions-arm32-testing.zip`
- AppLoad: `appload-arm32.zip`
- XOVI Binary: `xovi-arm32.so`
- KOReader: Standard reMarkable build

**reMarkable Paper Pro (64-bit ARM):**
- XOVI Extensions: `extensions-aarch64.zip`
- AppLoad: `appload-aarch64.zip` 
- XOVI Binary: `xovi-aarch64.so`
- KOReader: Architecture-specific aarch64 build

## Ready for Use

freeMarkable supports all reMarkable devices with reliable installations. Features include:

- **Tested Installation Process** - Successful XOVI installations across device types
- **Device Coverage** - Full support for all reMarkable generations including Paper Pro
- **Error Handling** - Backup and recovery systems
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS
- **Active Development** - Regular updates with bug fixes and improvements

## XOVI Triple-Tap Launch Feature

freeMarkable now includes optional support for **XOVI Triple-Tap Launch** - a power button handler that enables launching XOVI by triple-pressing the power button.

### How It Works
- **Triple-Press Detection**: Uses evtest to monitor power button presses
- **Systemd Service**: Runs as a background service for reliable detection
- **Architecture Support**: Automatically selects correct binaries for your device (armv6l/armv7l/aarch64)
- **Optional Installation**: Can be enabled during XOVI installation or added later

### Usage
1. **During Installation**: Check the "Enable Triple-Tap Launch" option in the GUI or use `--enable-tripletap` flag in CLI
2. **Triple-Press Power**: Press the power button three times quickly to launch XOVI

### Requirements
- **XOVI Installation**: Triple-tap feature requires XOVI to be installed first
- **All Devices Supported**: Works on reMarkable 1, 2, and Paper Pro

### Command Line Usage
```bash
# Enable triple-tap during full installation
python resources/main.py --enable-tripletap

# Enable triple-tap with launcher-only installation
python resources/main.py --launcher-only --enable-tripletap
```

## Known Issues:
Sometimes, if the main app (Xochitl) fails to reload properly, a bug in the reMarkable OS (Codex), will cause the USB connection to fail to engage.

In this case, connect your computer, and reMarkable to the same WiFi network, ensure you can reach it over ping/ssh, then use freeMarkable and select the 'Ethernet Fix' option in the settings menu.

This is why we have the safeguard of the WiFi connection before freeMarkable will proceed.
